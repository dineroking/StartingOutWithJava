/*
The Guesser class is set up to generate a random number from 1-1000, and allows 10 guesses to get the number.

  Your task is to write a method 'get_number' (Guesser.prototype.getNumber() in javascript) inside the Guesser class to identify a random number from 1-1000.

You should use the method:

  this.guess(number)
Which will return either:

"Too high!" If the guess is too high.
"Too low!" If the guess is too low.
  or "Correct!" If the guess is correct.
  You can only call this method 10 times before an exception is raised.*/
