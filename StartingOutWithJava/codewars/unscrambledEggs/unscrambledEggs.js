/*Unscramble the eggs.
 
 The string given to your function has had an "egg" inserted directly after each consonant. You need to return the string before it became eggcoded.
 
 example:
 
 unscrambleEggs("Beggegeggineggneggeregg"); => Beginner
 
 Kata is supposed to be for beginners to practice regular expressions, so commenting would be appreciated.*/
