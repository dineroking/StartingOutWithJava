/*
 You have a fashion catalog, an inventory of items from various high-fashion designers.
 Each designer has a lineup of shoes. Each shoe has a name and a price.
 
 It looks like this:
 var currentInventory = [
 {
 name: 'Brunello Cucinelli',
 shoes: [
 {name: 'tasselled black low-top lace-up', price: 1000},
 {name: 'tasselled green low-top lace-up', price: 1100},
 {name: 'plain beige suede moccasin', price: 950},
 {name: 'plain olive suede moccasin', price: 1050}
 ]
 },
 {
 name: 'Gucci',
 shoes: [
 {name: 'red leather laced sneakers', price: 800},
 {name: 'black leather laced sneakers', price: 900}
 ]
 }
 ];
 
 Look up all the shoes across all the designers and list them out in a flat list:
 {designer name}, {shoe name}, {price}
 {designer name}, {shoe name}, {price}
 
 E.g.,
 Brunello Cucinelli, tasselled black low-top lace-up, 1000
 Brunello Cucinelli, tasselled green low-top lace-up, 1100
 ...
 
 Write your own unit tests.*/

function renderInventory( inventory ) {
  // your code here
  // hint: before you just dive into coding...
  // it's a good idea to sketch out a skeleton like you've been seeing earlier in this module...
}
