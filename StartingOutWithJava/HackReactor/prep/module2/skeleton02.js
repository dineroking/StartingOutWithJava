 An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive.
 
 Write and test a function that determines whether a string is an isogram.
 
 Notes:
 * Assume your input is only letters.
 * Assume the empty string is an isogram.
 * Ignore case.
 * Follow the pseudocode exactly!

function isIsogram( text ) {
  // add each char to a set

  // note: a set drops dup values
  // thus, to see if all the chars were unique,
  // check length of text and the size of the set
