/*
 This is a variation of the "Fashion Inventory" problem.
 
 Please DO NOT paste code from before, however. Tackle each problem on its own.
 
 It's the same inventory data structure as earlier:
 
 var inventory = [
 {
 name: 'Brunello Cucinelli',
 shoes: [
 {name: 'tasselled black low-top lace-up', price: 1000},
 {name: 'tasselled green low-top lace-up', price: 1100},
 {name: 'plain beige suede moccasin', price: 950},
 {name: 'plain olive suede moccasin', price: 1050}
 ]
 },
 {
 name: 'Gucci',
 shoes: [
 {name: 'red leather laced sneakers', price: 800},
 {name: 'black leather laced sneakers', price: 900}
 ]
 }
 ];
 
 Now output the average cost of all shoes per designer in this format:
 
 var expected = {
 'designers': [
 {
 'name': 'Brunello Cucinelli',
 'averagePrice': 1025
 },
 {
 'name': 'Gucci',
 'averagePrice': 850
 }
 ]
 };
 
 Write your own unit tests.*/
