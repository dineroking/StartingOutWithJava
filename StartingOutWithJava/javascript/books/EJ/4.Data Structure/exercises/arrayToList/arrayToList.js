/*
A common data structure is the list (not to be confused with the array). A list is a nested set of objects, with the first object holding a reference to the second, the second to the third, and so on.
  var list  = {
  value: 1,
  rest: {
    value: 2,
    rest: {
      value:  3,
      rest: null
    }
  }
};

Write a function arrayToList that builds up a data structure like the previous one when given [1, 2, 3] as an argument, and write a listToArray function that produces an array from a list. Also write the helper functions prepend, which takes an element and a list and creates a new list that adds the element to the front of the input list, and nth, which takes a list and a number and returns the element at the given position in the list, or undefined when there is no such element.

If you havenâ€™t already, also write a recursive version of nth.
